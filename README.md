### **Step 1: Data Cleaning & Preparation**
- **Remove Duplicates:**    
- **Check for Missing Values:**  
- **Standardize Dates:**  
- **Format Numerical Columns:**  

---

### **Step 2: Pension Payment Reconciliation**
- **Discrepancy Calculation:**  
- **Risk Identification:**  
- **Analyse Discrepancies:**  

---

### **Step 3: Pension Trend Analysis**
- **Total Pension Payments per Pension Type:**  
  Pivot Tables were used to summarise total pension payments based on **pension type** (e.g., Defined Benefit vs. Defined Contribution).  
- **Average Employer vs. Employee Contributions:**  
  Pivot Tables were used to calculate the average contributions by both employers and employees.  
- **Pension Payment Trends Over Time:**  
  The trend in pension payments over time was analysed by grouping data based on the **Last Payment Date**.

### **Step 4: Generate Reports & Insights**
- **Key Pension Statistics:**  
  Key statistics, such as **total pension payments** and **average discrepancy**, were compiled for reporting.  

- **Graphs/Charts:**  
  Visualizations were created to represent key insights, including:  
  - Bar chart of pension types (e.g., Defined Benefit vs. Defined Contribution).  
  - Line chart showing payment trends over time.

## Technologies Used
- **Microsoft Excel** for data analysis, pivot tables, and visualization.
- **Excel Functions** like `TEXT`, `IF`, `VLOOKUP` and `ABS` for data processing and reconciliation.
